# C-Programming-

*This repository documents my learning journey in C programming with a focus on building strong fundamentals for electronics and embedded systems.*

## Programs

### Basic
*This folder contains basic C programs written to understand core programming concepts such as input/output operations, conditional statements, loops, and basic string handling. These programs build the foundation required for problem solving.*

### Array
*This folder contains C programs based on array operations, including traversal, searching, sorting, reversing, and frequency counting. These programs focus on logical problem solving and efficient data handling using arrays.*

### Pointer
*This folder contains C programs demonstrating the use of pointers and double pointers, including memory access, call by reference, and pointer-based function operations. These concepts are essential for low-level programming and embedded systems.*

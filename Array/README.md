## Array

### Programs 

1. *Linear Search in Array* - C program to Find a Key element in an array using Linear search.
2. *sum* - C program to find the sum of all the elements in an Array
3. *Maximum* - C program to find the maximum value element in an Array of Integers
4. *Cout occurrence* - C program to find the number of times same element occurs in an Array 
5. *Reverse* - C program to print the elements of an Array in reverse order by using another Array
6. *Bubble Sort Binary Search* - This C program demonstrates the use and implementation of Bubble Sort and Binary Search together. The user can input an array with n elements in any order, and the program automatically rearranges the elements in ascending order using Bubble Sort, after sorting it Searches for a Specific element(key) using binary search and determines how many time the given key element appears in the array
7. *Selection-sorting* - This program implements selection sorting and linear search in C. It allows the user to input an array of integers, sorts them, and counts occurrences of a specified element.
8. *2D Array & function table* - C program to store and print the multiplication table of 2 and 3 using and 2 dimensions array of size 2×10. Demonstrates passing of 2D array into a function to perform calculations and store the data then calling the it for printing the stored value.
